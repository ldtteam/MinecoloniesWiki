'''Installing Miecolonies Mod on your Original Minecraft Launcher (NO Curse Client, no other mods)''' 
 This process is for installing only the Minecolonies mod in your original Minecraft launcher. You will not be able to connect to the '''Minecolonies Official 1.12.2'''  Server due to the server having a balanced variety of other mods as well.

 For connecting to the Official Server install the Curse Client or visit the [https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/minecolonies-testpack/relations/dependencies Curse Minecolonies TestPack] site for a list of all mods used on Server. If all these additional mods are manually downloaded and installed as well, you will be able to connect to the official Server. The Official Minecolonies Server Address is:

 Installation of the MineColonies mod is very simple. It does require Minecraft Forge to be able to integrate minecolonies mod into the Minecraft game.
 We cannot offer support on the installation of Minecraft Forge. This guide is meant as a general guide for the original Minecraft launcher only for current version 1.12.2 (as of the writing of this post).
* Go to the [http://files.minecraftforge.net/?forums Minecraft Forge] files download section and Download the "Recommended" Version.

* Run the downloaded recommended version and make sure it's on "Install Client". Installation path is preset according to Minecraft's original installation path. If you have it installed in a different directory change the installation directory. When it's done you will see a "Complete" message.

Once you have successfully installed Forge, follow these steps:
* Go to the [[https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/minecolonies/files Minecolonies Curse Forge Download]] site and download the latest 1.12.2 version of MineColonies.
* On your computer go to the ".minecraft/mods" folder. To be able to find this folder, just click on the start button and in the search box type: %appdata% and hit "search". It will open the folder where you can find the " .minecraft " folder. Open this folder and inside you will find the " mods " folder.
* Once you are in the " .minecraft/mods " folder, copy the downloaded Minecolonies file you downloaded in Step 1 and paste it here. NOTE: DO NOT extract the file if the option appears. Just put the .jar file in here without extracting it's contents.
* Run your Original Minecraft launcher and make sure you have the " forge " profile loaded and hit Play
