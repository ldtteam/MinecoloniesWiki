The Cowhand's Hut is where the Cowhand will breed, butcher, and milk (if you have the option enabled) cows for food and leather. You will have to capture and bring in two cows to the Cowhand's Hut, as the Cowhand will not catch and bring in any cows.

**Note:** The Cowhand will only keep two cows alive per hut level, so at level 5 they will have ten cows in their holding pens to breed and butcher. This means they will be faster at producing and collecting meat and leather. So:


| Building Level | Cows Housed |
|----------------|-------------|
| 1              | 2           |
| 2              | 4           |
| 3              | 6           |
| 4              | 8           |
| 5              | 10          |
