The rack is the MineColonies version of a chest. It can be combined with another rack to make a double rack, like a double chest. Racks are used almost exclusively in the mod's schematics.

Racks can be crafted at the {% building_link sawmill %}.

## Using the Rack

Use the rack like you would use a chest.
