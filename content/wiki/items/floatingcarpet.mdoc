Floating carpet is a decoration. It allows you to place carpet in the air without using string to hold it up. Other than that, it's the exact same as vanilla Minecraft carpet.

Floating carpet can be crafted at the {% building_link fletcher %}.

## Using Floating Carpet

Use floating carpet for awnings or other builds where you would use carpet with string.
