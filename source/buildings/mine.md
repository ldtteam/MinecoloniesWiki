The Mine is where you can hire a miner to work the mine, or the quarry. At the mine, the Miner will mine for ores and materials. Once they are hired, the Miner will create a shaft downward and then branch out.

**Hint:** The shaft the Miner creates downwards will go to a specific depth depending on the level of the Mine:

| Mine Level | Shaft Y Level |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| 1 | 50 |
| 2 | 30 |
| 3+ | Bedrock |

Here you can assign what level of the Mine the Miner will create their mineshafts (nodes). If a level has a red number next to it, that means the Miner is currently mining that level. The Miner will ignore orders to mine at a specific level until the entire mineshaft is completed to the maximum depth their hut's level allows. You can also click Repair, to tell the Miner to restore that level to its original state. This can be useful if a fire breaks out in the mineshaft.</li><br>
