## About the Barracks

The Barracks is the ultimate protection for your colony. The Barracks will hold 4 [Barracks Towers](../buildings/barrackstower) within its structure. The Barracks Towers (unlike the normal [Guard Towers](../../source/buildings/guardtower)) will employ *and* house 1 [Guard](../../source/workers/guard) for every level built! Each new Guard will need a bed in a house in order to spawn. However, once they are hired at the Barracks Tower, that becomes their new residence and the bed in the house will open up for another new citizen. Each Barracks Tower can house and employ 5 Guards for a total of 20 Guards for your colony.

| Barracks Level | Max # of Barracks Towers | Max Level of Barracks Towers |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 4 | 5 |

<strong>Note:</strong> If you place Barracks/Barracks Towers near your colony border and level them up, your border will expand.

      <li><strong>Inventory:</strong> Here you can access the Barracks' storage, where the Guards staying in the Barracks take and deposit materials. They will also use any [racks](../../source/decoblocks/rack) or chests in the Barracks, so be sure to check those as well!</li>
