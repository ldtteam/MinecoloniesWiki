# Colony Protection System

Our Colony Protection System (once a [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) is placed) can be toggled in the [config file](../../source/misc/configfile).

The protection includes turning explosions off (by default), so creepers, TNT, and any modded blocks won't destroy your colony. By default, only the colony owner can break or place blocks within a colony, but you can add other players in the permissions section of the Town Hall GUI.

It also covers from Y 0 to Y 256, so you don't have to worry about griefing from bedrock to the sky limit.

**Note:** The protection system depends on the border system. Only areas that are within the colony's border will be protected. See the [Colony Border System](../../source/systems/border) page for more information.
