# Worker System

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:20pt;"><img src="../../assets/images/misc/Sleep.png" alt="Sleep"><b> If it is raining, snowing, nighttime, or a citizen died yesterday (in-game time), your citizens will stop working!</b></p>

## Traits
When hiring a worker at a hut, the primary trait used in that work will be highlighted in **green** and the secondary trait in **yellow** to help you decide which citizen is the best worker for the job. The higher a worker's level, the faster and more efficient they will be.

These skills make up the worker's level. The formula is (Primary Trait + Secondary Trait)/4 = Level (rounded down).

For example, if Adaptability is the primary trait and Athletics secondary, and the worker assigned has Adaptability 29 and Athletics 16, then (29+16)/4=11.25.That means that this worker's level will be 11!

Workers' skills/levels increase as they work. Their level is limited by the level of the worker's home. The level of a worker's work hut and their Intelligence skill level affect the speed that they level up.

| Home Level | Max Worker Level |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| 0          | 1                |
| 1          | 5                |
| 2          | 10               |
| 3          | 15               |
| 4          | 20               |
| 5          | 100              |
