# Worker System

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:20pt;"><img src="../../assets/images/misc/Sleep.png" alt="Sleep"><b> If it is raining, snowing, nighttime, or a citizen died yesterday (in-game time), your citizens will stop working!</b></p>

## Traits
When hiring a worker at a hut, the primary trait used in that work will be highlighted in **green** and the secondary trait in **yellow** to help you decide which citizen is the best worker for the job. The higher a worker's level, the faster and more efficient they will be. Each trait also has a specific bonus for the job. To see these bonuses, please visit the worker pages.

![Traits](../../assets/images/misc/traits.png)

These skills make up the worker's level. The formula is (Primary Trait + Secondary Trait)/4 = Level (rounded down).

For example, if Adaptability is the primary trait and Athletics secondary, and the worker assigned has Adaptability 29 and Athletics 16, then (29+16)/4=11.25.That means that this worker's level will be 11!

Workers' skills/levels increase as they work. Their level is limited by the level of the worker's home. The level of a worker's work hut and their Intelligence skill level affect the speed that they level up.

| Home Level | Max Worker Level |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| 0          | 1                |
| 1          | 5                |
| 2          | 10               |
| 3          | 15               |
| 4          | 20               |
| 5          | 100              |

## Tool/Sword Levels

The type of tools/swords workers can use depends on the level of a worker's work hut.

| Work Hut Level | Max Tool/Sword Level                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0              | Wood or Gold + 0 enchantments                                                                                            |
| 1              | Stone + 0 enchantments (OR wood/gold + 1 enchantment)                                                                    |
| 2              | Iron + 0 enchantments (OR wood/gold + 2 enchantment OR stone + 1 enchantment)                                            |
| 3              | Diamond + 0 enchantments (OR wood/gold + 3 enchantments OR stone + 2 enchantments OR Iron + 1 enchantment)               |
| 4              | Netherite + 0 enchantments (OR wood/gold + 4 enchants OR Stone + 3 enchants OR Iron + 2 enchants OR diamond + 1 enchant) |
| 5              | All Tools + unlimited enchantments                                                                                       |

## Bow/Fishing Rod Levels

There is also a system in place for the type of bows and fishing rods workers can use. This also depends on the level of a worker's work hut.

| Work Hut Level | Enchantments            |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| 0              | 0 enchantments          |
| 1              | 0 enchantments          |
| 2              | 1 enchantments          |
| 3              | 2 enchantments          |
| 4              | 3 enchantments          |
| 5              | Unlimited enchantments  |

Modded fishing rods with higher durability may require a higher Work Hut level.

## Guard Armor Levels

There is also a system in place for the type of armor [Guards](../../source/workers/guard) can use. This depends on the level of their Tower.

| Tower Level   | Max Armor Damage Reduction |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| 0             | Leather                    |
| 1             | Gold                       |
| 2             | Chain                      |
| 3             | Iron                       |
| 4             | Diamond                    |
| 5             | All (including [Plate](../../source/items/platearmor)) |

Guards can use most modded armor within these rules, though they may not be able to use or benefit from special traits of that armor.
