This tutorial assumes you have already installed the mod or modpack. If you'd like instructions on how to <a id="install">install</a> our [Official Modpack](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/minecolonies), you can find instructions for doing that on Twitch [here](../../source/installation/twitch), on MultiMMC [here](../../source/installation/multimmc), and on Java (Forge) [here](../../source/installation/java). 

## Quick Walkthrough 

Before you get started on your new colony, you should find your perfect location. You need a large enough area for a full city.

You should also gather as many resources as you can. Once you figure out which style you want, you should start gathering enough wood for that style, as well as cobble, coal, iron, flowers, and some saplings for other trees not in your style as they are often used as decoration items.

You should also gather enough food to feed yourself and your initial citizens until you can get workers who gather and cook food. 

### Step 1: Supply Camp/Supply Ship
  
  Once you have your location determined, you must place a [Supply Ship](../../source/items/supplycampandship) or [Supply Camp](../../source/items/supplycampandship). You can only place one of these. The Supply Camp and Ship have the Town Hall block you need to officially start your colony. They also have some other supplies you may need during the building of your colony. Once you have the Town Hall block and the [building tool](../../source/items/buildingtool), the remaining camp or ship is just decoration. You can leave it if you wish or tear it down.
  
### Step 2 Town Hall
  
  The [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) block is what actually creates the colony. This is where you start using the building tool to place buildings. Using the building tool ensures you can see exactly where the building will be, which direction it will face, and if it is at the right y level (some buildings need to be raised to the correct y level).
  
  Once the Town Hall block is placed, you will start receiving your initial 4 citizens.
  
### Step 3 Builder
  
  Before anything can be built, you need a [Builder](../../source/workers/builder). The Builder must build their own [Builder's Hut](../../source/buildings/builder) before building any other huts, as they cannot build or upgrade a hut to a higher level than their own hut level.
  
### Step 4 Lumberjack
  
  If your style is wood, it's recommended to build a [Lumberjack's Hut](../../source/buildings/lumberjack) next. That way your new [Lumberjack](../../source/workers/lumberjack) can start gathering wood for your next builds and for tools and other items.
  
### Step 5 Miner
  
  Stone is another major need for any colony, so a [Mine](../../source/buildings/mine) is the next logical step.
  
### Step 6 Food
  
  The next major thing you need for your colony is food. The fastest way to get food is to build a [Fisherman's Hut](../../source/buildings/fisherman). You could build a [Farm](../../source/buildings/farm&field) or one of the animal herders, but a Fisherman is faster.
  
### Step 7 Rest of the Colony
  
  This is where you need to decide what you need next, based on how you play and what your colony needs. But you have several things to look at. Once you get seven citizens you can get attacked by raiders and you may want to build a [Guard Tower](../../source/buildings/guardtower), or you may get a sick citizen and want to build a [Hospital](../../source/buildings/hospital), or you may decide you want a [Sawmill](../../source/buildings/sawmill) to make the needed items for a worker. Or you may just want to have a specific worker, or you found a great place for a certain hut. You decide how your colony will grow!

## Detailed Walkthrough
<br>

If you're here, **CONGRATULATIONS!** You have already <a href="#install">installed</a> MineColonies and are ready to embark on an adventure to explore, conquer and establish your own colony. Work hard and turn it into a thriving town. Hone your leadership skills and grow grow grow into a city! Lastly, can you be a grand leader and finally achieve a metropolis? (Check your ingame MineColonies Achievements.)

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../assets/images/tutorial/achievements.png" alt="Achievements"></p>

So, the first thing you want to do is find the perfect spot to settle down. But, before you do that, there are two things you have to consider. The following comments are the most important you should read and consider to ensure a successful Town and avoid frustration. Please read all considerations first, before placing your [Supply Ship](../items/supplycampandship) or [Supply Camp](../items/supplycampandship). Even before starting to play:

**Hint:** The most important tool you will need for the entire mod is the building tool (check our [building tool](../items/buildingtool) page). Craft the building tool so you can place all the huts and the Supply Ship or Supply Camp in the perfect spot.

</div>
<br />

### Placement of the Supply Ship or Supply Camp 

 When you place the [Supply Ship](../items/supplycampandship), it will spawn a chest that will contain the [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) block and the [building tool](../../source/items/buildingtool). To place the Supply Ship, you need to have a large enough body of water. The Supply Ship is 32 x 11 blocks in length and width. So the recommended body of water is at least 32 x 20. Use the building tool to see where the ship will be placed. **Once the Supply Ship is placed, you can't place another Ship or Camp in this world anymore.**
 
**Hint:** If you're not using the building tool and aren't able to place the Supply Ship, try it block by block: one to the right, left, closer or further from the water - or even directly over the water creating a walkway block by block. The area cannot have any seaweed, coral, etc.

 When you place the [Supply Camp](../items/supplycampandship), it will spawn a chest that will contain the [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) block and the [building tool](../../source/items/buildingtool). To place the Supply Camp, you need to have a large enough flat, clear piece of land. The recommended size must be at least 16 x 17 blocks. **Once the Supply Camp is placed, you can't place another Camp or Ship in this world anymore.**

**Hint:** If you're not using the building tool and aren't able to place the Supply Camp, try it block by block: one to the right, left, closer or further from the area you cleared. The area cannot contain any holes or have any flowers, grass, ferns, etc.

### Town Hall

 The protected area of your colony (once the [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) has been placed) will be a 8 chunks radius, measured from where you placed your Town Hall block the first time (Default config). Therefore, plan carefully where you want to place your Town Hall. 128 blocks (8 chunks x 8 chunks) in every direction will be your protected Town area including mountains, hills, lakes, oceans, caves, world generated structures, etc. from bedrock to the sky limit.

- **Note**: You can configure your own town area radius in the configuration options of the mod or the the minecolonies-common.toml file inside the ```../minecraft/config/``` folder of your own world.

Due to the protected area of each colony, you have to scout carefully your surroundings to make sure you are clear of any other colonies nearby preventing you from placing your Town Hall or limiting your colony area in that direction.

If there is another colony too close to your current position, you won't be able to place a Town Hall.

If you want to know whether there is a colony too close to your current position, we've included some information in the debug screen (displayed when you press F3) which contains a real-time tracker showing you the distance to the next colony, the colony you're currently in, or if there is no colony close at all. Plus, if there is a colony close to your current position, it will also show you the required distance away to place your Town Hall.

<p class="text-center"><img src="../../assets/images/tutorial/next_colony.png" alt="Next Colony"></p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="../../assets/images/tutorial/players_colony.png" alt="Player's Colony"></p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="../../assets/images/tutorial/no_colony.png" alt="No Colony"></p>

For example, in the official MineColonies server it will be the default 8 chunk radius (8 + 8 + 1 {center Chunk where Town Hall was placed} = 17 chunks or 272 total blocks required). It therefore, will tell you: "Next colony is XXX blocks away. (272 required to place a colony)."

**Now, after you have explored, thought carefully, planned, and found the perfect spot to start your colony, let's take a look at the steps to get your colony running!**

## Setting Up Your Colony

### Step 1

Get enough materials and craft your Supply Ship/Camp. Now place it with the <a href="#build_tool">building tool</a> or by right-clicking a block with it to place your Supply Ship/Camp. There will be a chest inside the placed Ship/Camp with a Town Hall block and a building tool.

- **Hint:** Gather as many materials as possible to be able to give them to your [Builder](../../source/workers/builder) when they start building. They will ask you for all kinds of materials they will need for each building or upgrade, depending on the style of building you have chosen. The materials needed for most styles will be mainly wood, cobblestone, and torches for the lower levels. Further upgrades will require more elaborate materials.

### Step 2

After you have carefully decided where you want to place your [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) (remember, the position where you placed the Town Hall block at first will be the center of your colony's protected area. Once placed, the area will be set and cannot be changed), use your <a href="#build_tool">building tool</a> to place the Town Hall. Once you commit to the placement of the Town Hall (the green checkmark), the Town Hall block will be placed. To officially start a colony, you need to right-click on the block, then select Create New Colony. Once you've done this, your initial four citizens will start appearing! 

You can now right-click the Town Hall block again to look at its graphical user interface, or GUI for short:

### Town Hall GUI

<i>You can use the tabs on the left side to switch between different categories.</i>

<br>

#### <strong>Information:</strong> This is the overall information section of the Town Hall GUI.
   
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/th_information.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="TH GUI Information Tab">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Page 1: </strong>Here you will see some statistics on your citizens, like the number of citizens you have and if they are unemployed or workers. If they are workers, you will see what job they have.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Page 2: </strong>Here you will see the overall happiness of the colony's citizens as well as any events that the colony is having (future use).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<br>

#### <strong>Actions:</strong> This is the most important section.

<div class="row">

    </ul>
  </div>
</div>  

---
<p><strong>Permissions Pg. 5 & 6: </strong>In this section, you can add a certain block's position that will bypass the protection system for interaction. Any player will be able to interact with that block as long as their rank includes the permission 'Access Free-Blocks.'</p>

    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<br>

#### <strong>Citizens: </strong>This section displays the names and skill levels of the citizens in your colony.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/th_citizens.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="TH GUI Citizens Tab">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">

    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<br>

#### <strong>Settings: </strong>This section is where you can control how your citizens will be hired and assigned housing in your colony, among other things.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/th_settings.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="TH GUI Settings Tab">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <ul>
    <br>
      <li><strong>Page 1: </strong>There are four buttons here:</li>
        <ul>
        <br>
          <li><strong>Worker hiring mode: </strong>Clicking on this button lets you switch between automatic or manual. If it's in automatic mode, you can't fire or hire any citizen from any worker hut and the best unemployed citizen will be hired for you. In manual mode you will be able to <i>hire</i> and <i>fire</i> whichever citizen you want at any time.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Housing assignment mode: </strong>Clicking on this button lets you switch between automatic or manual. If it's in automatic mode, citizens will be assigned a house as soon as they spawn (if housing is available). In manual mode, you can select which citizens will be housed in each <a href="../../source/buildings/citizenhut"> Citizen's Hut</a> or <a href="../../source/buildings/tavern"> Tavern</a>. This is better if you have a large colony and many workers spread out in a large area so you can house your citizens as close as possible to their workplace.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Print help messages: </strong>Clicking on this button lets you choose whether MineColonies help messages will appear in the chat. It is recommended that this be turned on for first-time players.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Citizens can move in: </strong>Clicking on this button lets you choose whether new kids will be born in your colony.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Page 2: </strong>Pick Team Color: Whatever color you pick from here, your Guards will have a glow of this color around them when you put them in follow mode at their <a href="../../source/buildings/guardtower"> Guard Tower</a> or <a href="../../source/buildings/barrackstower"> Barracks Tower</a>. This is for the PVP system, so you know which Guards are yours when you are fighting. Your citizens' names will also be in this color.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<br>

#### <strong>Work Orders: </strong>Here you will see the work orders your [Builders](../../source/workers/builder) have in the order they have been assigned. Builders will not start another order until they have successfully completed the top one.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/th_workorders.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="TH GUI Work Orders Tab">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Page 1: </strong>Blank page except for the header (future use).</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Page 2: </strong>Here are all the build orders for this colony (including decorations and your own schematics as well as huts). Your Builders will complete the builds from top to bottom, and you can change the priority of the builds by moving them up or down in the list. You can also delete work orders. When you delete a work order that is currently being built, the Builder will stop building and will continue where they left off if you create the work order again.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<br>

#### <strong>Happiness: </strong>This is the section for the global happiness of your colony so you can see what area needs more attention to raise the happiness level.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/th_happiness.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="TH GUI Work Orders Tab">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <ul>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Page 1: </strong>The happiness indices. You can keep track of the areas that will lower or raise the happiness of your citizens here. The colors, in order from best to worst, are: green (super happy), blue (happy), yellow (not happy), and red (big problem here-your citizens are definitely not happy). There's also black, which will show up if something went wrong.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Page 2: </strong>Blank for now (future use).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>  
<br>

### Step 3

Before any other building can be built, you must craft the [Builder's hut](../../source/buildings/builder) block and use your <a href="#build_tool">building tool</a> to place his building. Once you commit to the placement of the Builder's Hut (the green checkmark), the block will be placed and a Builder will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best [traits](../../source/systems/worker) for a Builder if you changed this in the setting tab in the Town Hall's GUI).
You now officially have a [Builder](../../source/workers/builder)! CONGRATULATIONS!
When accessing the Builder's Hut block by right-clicking on it, you will see a GUI with different options:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/buildergui1.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="Builder's Hut GUI">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <ul>
      {% for item in site.data.gui.global %}
        <li><strong>{{ item.button }}:</strong> {{ item.content }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
 <div class="col-sm-12 col-md"><br>
    <p>By pressing the arrow button in the top right corner of the GUI, you will be taken to page 2 of the GUI where you will find the following:</p>
  </div>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/buildergui2.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="Builder GUI 2">
  </div>
</div>

<br>

You will have to click Build Options on the Builder's Hut, then click Build Building. This will give your new Builder the build assignment so they can build their own hut first. If the Builder's Hut is not built, the Builder cannot build any other buildings. 

The Builder will ask for the materials they need. Right-click on them when they have a red icon above their head to see the materials they currently need.

- **Hint:** If you see that the Builder hasn't finished a build order and you don't see them asking for any materials, go to the Builder's Hut, recall the Builder, and wait a bit to see what they need. Also, check page 2 of the Builder's Hut GUI and see what resources are in red (those are missing resources).

### Step 4

Once the Builder has finished their hut, you're ready to start building any other building you want! Just craft the desired block and use your [building tool](../../source/items/buildingtool) to place the building. Once it's placed, go into the GUI for the new block, click Build Options, and then click Build Building. It's that simple!

- **Hint:** Consider upgrading the Builder's Hut to level 2 as soon as you can so the Builder can upgrade other buildings.

### Final Notes

You have now completed the most important steps completed to start and create your colony!

Your question now is probably, "What to build next?" The [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall), [Mine](../../source/buildings/mine), [Sawmill](../../source/buildings/sawmill), [Farm](../../source/buildings/farm&field), [Fisherman](../../source/buildings/fisherman), [Guard Tower](../../source/buildings/guardtower), [Deliveryman](../../source/buildings/deliveryman), [Bakery](../../source/buildings/bakery), [Restaurant](../../source/buildings/restaurant) and more are probably good places to start. 

But you start with only 4 citizens! Now what? Well, the next step after your 4 citizens are employed and are working hard is to plan and place the [Citizen's Hut](../../source/buildings/citizenhut). This will give you additional citizens for each level of a Citizen's Hut you build in your colony (after your inital four citizens are housed)! Now, what do you do with so many citizens? You cannot assign more than 1 worker per hut. Therefore, consider building additional huts for more Miners, Lumberjacks, Builders, Farmers, Fishermen, and many more! 

- **Hint:** Upgrade your buildings to the highest level possible (level 5 for almost all of them) to get achievements (and increase the speed at which the worker [levels](../../source/systems/worker)).
