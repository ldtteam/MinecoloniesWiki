This tutorial assumes you have already installed the mod or modpack. If you'd like instructions on how to <a id="install">install</a> our [Official Modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/minecolonies-testpack), you can find instructions for doing that on Java (Forge) [here](../../source/installation/java), on GDLauncher [here](../../source/installation/gdlauncher), and on the Curseforge Launcher [here](../../source/installation/curseforge). 

## Quick Walkthrough 

Before you get started on your new colony, you should find your perfect location. You need a large enough area for a full city-at least 8x8 chunks, and decently flat.

You should also gather as many resources as you can-wood, as well as cobble, coal, iron, flowers, string, leather, wool, saplings, and food. 

### Step 1: Supply Camp/Supply Ship
  
  Once you have chosen a location for your colony, you must place a [Supply Ship](../../source/items/supplycampandship) or [Supply Camp](../../source/items/supplycampandship). You can only place one of these per world. The Supply Camp/Ship gives you the Town Hall block you need to officially start your colony. They also have some other supplies you may need during the building of your colony. Once you have the Town Hall block and the [build tool](../../source/items/buildtool), the remaining camp/ship is just decoration. You can leave it or tear it down.
  
### Step 2: Town Hall
  
  The [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) block is what actually creates the colony. It also functions as the center of it. This is where you start using the build tool to place buildings. Using the build tool ensures you can see exactly where the building will be, which direction it will face, and if it is at the right Y level (some buildings need to be raised to the correct Y level).
  
  Once the Town Hall block is placed, you will start receiving your initial 4 citizens.
  
### Step 3: Builder
  
  Before anything can be built, you need a [Builder](../../source/workers/builder). The Builder must build their own [Builder's Hut](../../source/buildings/builder) before building any other huts, and they cannot build or upgrade a hut to a higher level than their own hut level.
  
### Step 4: Tavern

  Your colonists will need a place to sleep and a house, so it is recommended to build a [Tavern](../../source/buildings/tavern) next. The Tavern also allows visitors to come to your colony, and you can recruit them to stay as citizens.

### Step 5: Food
  
  The next major thing you need for your colony is food. The fastest way to get food is to build a [Fisher's Hut](../../source/buildings/fisher). You could build a [Farm](../../source/buildings/farm&field) or one of the animal herders, but a Fisher is faster. Building a [Restaurant](../../source/buildings/restaurant) may also be advisable if you don't want to feed your colonists (or cook their food) by hand.

### Step 6: Forester
  
  If your style is wood, it's recommended to build a [Forester's Hut](../../source/buildings/forester) next. That way your new [Forester](../../source/workers/forester) can start gathering wood for your next builds and for tools and other items.
  
### Step 7: Miner
  
  Stone and ores are another major need for any colony, so a [Mine](../../source/buildings/mine) is the next logical step.
  
### Step 8: Warehouse and courier

  At this point, you might be tired of bringing all of the resources to the Builder and taking them from the Fisher, Forester, Miner, etc. You also might want to store items in one place. Well, the [Warehouse](../../source/buildings/warehouse) and [Courierâ€™s Hut](../../source/buildings/courier) are the solution you are looking for! [Couriers](../../source/workers/courier) transport items between the Warehouse and all of the workplaces.
  
### Step 9: Rest of the Colony
  
  This is where you need to decide what you need next, based on how you play and what your colony needs. But you have several things to look at. Once you get seven citizens you can get attacked by raiders and you may want to build a [Guard Tower](../../source/buildings/guardtower), or you may get a sick citizen and want to build a [Hospital](../../source/buildings/hospital), or you may decide you want a [Sawmill](../../source/buildings/sawmill) to make the needed items for a worker. Or you may just want to have a specific worker, or you found a great place for a certain hut. You decide how your colony will grow!

## Detailed Walkthrough
<br>

If you're here, **CONGRATULATIONS!** You have already <a href="#install">installed</a> MineColonies and are ready to embark on an adventure to explore, conquer and establish your own colony. Work hard and turn it into a thriving town. Hone your leadership skills and grow grow grow into a city! Lastly, can you be a grand leader and finally achieve a metropolis? (Check your ingame MineColonies Achievements.)

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../assets/images/tutorial/achievements.png" alt="Achievements"></p>

To avoid mistakes and frustation, read through this entire guide carefully before starting to play.


### Placement of the Supply Ship or Supply Camp 

To place the [Supply Ship](../items/supplycampandship), you need to have a large enough body of water (at least 32 x 20).
To place the [Supply Camp](../items/supplycampandship), you need to have a large enough flat, clear piece of land (at least 16x17 blocks).

When you place the Supply Ship/Camp, it will spawn a chest that will contain the [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) block and the [build tool](../../source/items/buildtool). **Once the Supply Ship/Camp is placed, you can't place another in the world.**

Place the Supply Ship/Camp by right-clicking the item directly on the water/ground -- if you have a build tool already, don't use it for this (you're expected to get the tool from the camp/ship rather than already having one).

**Hint:** If you're not able to place the Supply Camp/Ship, try it block by block: one to the right, left, closer or further from the area you cleared. The area cannot contain any holes or have any flowers, grass, ferns, seaweed, coral etc.

### Town Hall

 The protected area of your colony (once the [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) has been placed) will be a square 4 chunks in radius, measured from the chunk where you placed your Town Hall block the first time (with the default [config](../../source/misc/configfile)). Therefore, plan carefully where you want to place your Town Hall. 64 blocks (4 chunks x 4 chunks) in every direction from that chunk will be your protected Town area including mountains, hills, lakes, oceans, caves, world generated structures, etc. from bedrock to sky limit.

**Hint:** The most important tool you will need for the entire mod is the build tool (check our [build tool](../items/buildtool) page). Obtain one from the Supply Ship/Camp or craft another so you can place all the huts (including the Town Hall) in the perfect spot.

<p class="h4 text-center"><b>Build Tool Video.</b></p>

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mx-auto">
  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVGGDUXbTOY" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br />

Due to the protected area of each colony, you have to carefully scout your surrounding to make sure you are clear of any other colonies nearby preventing you from placing your Town Hall or limiting your colony area in that direction (in multiplayer, etc.). If there is another colony too close to your current position, you won't be able to place a Town Hall.

Location info of the next closest colony exits in the debug screen (displayed when you press F3). If there is a colony close to your current position, it will also show you the required distance away to place your Town Hall.

<p class="text-center"><img src="../../assets/images/tutorial/next_colony.png" alt="Next Colony"></p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="../../assets/images/tutorial/players_colony.png" alt="Player's Colony"></p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="../../assets/images/tutorial/no_colony.png" alt="No Colony"></p>

For example, in the official MineColonies server it will be the default 4 chunk radius (4 + 4 + 1 {center Chunk where Town Hall was placed} = 9 chunks or 144 total blocks required). It therefore, will tell you: "Next colony is XXX blocks away. (272 required to place a colony)."

**Now, after you have explored, thought carefully, planned, and found the perfect spot to start your colony, let's take a look at the steps to get your colony running!**

## Setting Up Your Colony

### Step 1

Get enough materials and craft your Supply Ship/Camp, then place it by right-clicking a block with it (do not use the build tool, if you happen to already have one). There will be a chest (or <a href="../../source/items/rack">rack</a>) inside the placed Ship/Camp with a Town Hall block and a build tool.

**Hint:** Gather as many materials as possible to give to your [Builder](../../source/workers/builder) when they start building. They will ask you for all kinds of materials for each building or upgrade, depending on the style of building you have chosen. The materials needed for most styles will be mainly wood, cobblestone, and torches for the lower levels. Further upgrades will require more elaborate materials.

### Step 2

After you have carefully decided where you want to place your [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) (remember, the position where you placed the Town Hall block at first will be the center of your colony's protected area. Once placed, the area will be set and cannot be changed), use your <a href="#build_tool">build tool</a> to place the Town Hall. Once you commit to the placement of the Town Hall (the green checkmark), the Town Hall block will be placed. To officially start a colony, you need to right-click on the block, then select Create New Colony. Once you've done this, your initial four citizens will start appearing! 

You can now right-click the Town Hall block again to look at its graphical user interface, or GUI for short:

### Town Hall GUI

<i>You can use the tabs on the left side to switch between different categories.</i>

<br>

#### <strong>Information:</strong> This is the overall information section of the Town Hall GUI.
   
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/th_information.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="TH GUI Information Tab">

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Page 1: </strong>Here you will see some statistics on your citizens, like the number of citizens you have and if they are unemployed or workers. If they are workers, you will see what job they have.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Page 2: </strong>Here you will see the overall happiness of the colony's citizens and any events that happened within the colony (the newest events are at the bottom). You can click the button to switch to a permission log, which will show any illegal actions that happened in the colony (like if a player tried to break a block when they aren't allowed to). Clicking the plus next to an illegal action will change it to a legal action if the player tries to do it again. For more information, see the <a href="../../source/systems/protection"> Protection system</a> and the Permission tab of the Town Hall GUI.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<br>

#### <strong>Actions:</strong> This is the most important section.

      <p><strong>Page 1: </strong>There are four buttons here:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Worker hiring mode: </strong>Clicking on this button lets you switch between automatic or manual. If it's in automatic mode, you can't fire or hire any citizen from any worker hut and the best unemployed citizen will be hired for you. In manual mode you will be able to <i>hire</i> and <i>fire</i> whichever citizen you want at any time.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Housing assignment mode: </strong>Clicking on this button lets you switch between automatic or manual. If it's in automatic mode, citizens will be assigned a house as soon as they spawn (if housing is available). In manual mode, you can select which citizens will be housed in each <a href="../../source/buildings/house"> House</a> or <a href="../../source/buildings/tavern"> Tavern</a>. This is better if you have a large colony and many workers spread out in a large area so you can house your citizens as close as possible to their workplace.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Print help messages: </strong>Clicking on this button lets you choose whether MineColonies help messages will appear in the chat. It is recommended that this be turned on for first-time players.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Kids will be born: </strong>Clicking on this button lets you choose whether new kids will be born in your colony.</li>p

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pick Team Color: </strong>Whatever color you pick from here, your Guards will have a glow of this color around them when you put them in follow mode at their <a href="../../source/buildings/guardtower"> Guard Tower</a> or <a href="../../source/buildings/barrackstower"> Barracks Tower</a>. This is for the PVP system, so you know which Guards are yours when you are fighting. Your citizens' names will also be in this color.</li>
			<br>
            <li><strong>Edit Colony Flag: </strong>Clicking this button will open up a banner designer where you can design your colony banner. Your <a href="../../source/workers/guard"> Knights</a> will wear the finished design on their shields, and it is also used in some schematics.</li>

			</div>
		</ul>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<br>

#### <strong>Work Orders: </strong>Here you will see the work orders your <a href="../../source/workers/builder"> Builders</a> have in the order they have been assigned. Builders will not start another order until they have successfully completed the top one.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">

      <br>
      <li><strong>Page 2: </strong>Here are all the build orders for this colony (including decorations and your own schematics as well as huts). Your Builders will complete the builds from top to bottom, and you can change the priority of the builds by moving them up or down in the list. You can also delete work orders. When you delete a work order that is currently being built, the Builder will stop building and will continue where they left off if you create the work order again.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<br>

#### <strong>Happiness: </strong>This is the section for the global happiness of your colony so you can see what area needs more attention to raise the happiness level.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/th_happiness.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="TH GUI Work Orders Tab">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <ul>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Page 1: </strong>The happiness indices. You can keep track of the areas that will lower or raise the happiness of your citizens here. The colors, in order from best to worst, are: green (super happy), blue (happy), yellow (not happy), and red (big problem here-your citizens are definitely not happy). There's also black, which will show up if something went wrong.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Page 2: </strong>Blank for now (future use).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>  
<br>

### Step 3

Before any other building can be built, you must craft the [Builder's Hut](../../source/buildings/builder) block and use your <a href="#build_tool">build tool</a> to place it. Once you commit to the placement of the Builder's Hut (the green checkmark), the block will be placed and a Builder will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best [traits](../../source/systems/worker) for a Builder if you changed this in the setting tab in the Town Hall's GUI).
You now officially have a [Builder](../../source/workers/builder)! CONGRATULATIONS!
When accessing the Builder's Hut block by right-clicking on it, you will see a GUI with different options:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/buildergui1.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="Builder's Hut GUI">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <ul>
      {% for item in site.data.gui.global %}
        <li><strong>{{ item.button }}:</strong> {{ item.content }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
 <div class="col-sm-12 col-md"><br>
    <p>By pressing the arrow button in the top right corner of the GUI, you will be taken to page 2 of the GUI where you will find the following:</p>
  </div>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/buildergui2.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="Builder GUI 2">
  </div>
</div>

<br>

You will have to click Build Options on the Builder's Hut, then click Build Building. This will give your new Builder the build assignment so they can build their own hut first. If the Builder's Hut is not built, the Builder cannot build any other buildings. 

The Builder will ask for the materials they need. Right-click on them when they have a red icon above their head to see the materials they currently need.

**Hint:** If you see that the Builder hasn't finished a build order and you don't see them asking for any materials, go to the Builder's Hut, recall the Builder, and wait a bit to see what they need. Also, check page 2 of the Builder's Hut GUI and see what resources are in red (those are missing resources).

### Step 4

Once the Builder has finished their hut, you're ready to start building any other building you want! Just craft the desired block and use your [build tool](../../source/items/buildtool) to place the building. Once it's placed, go into the GUI for the new block, click Build Options, and then click Build Building. It's that simple!

**Hint:** Consider upgrading the Builder's Hut to level 2 as soon as you can so the Builder can upgrade other buildings.

### Final Notes

You have now completed the most important steps completed to start and create your colony!

Your question now is probably, "What to build next?" The [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall), [Mine](../../source/buildings/mine), [Forester's Hut](../../source/buildings/forester), [Farm](../../source/buildings/farm&field), [Fisher's Hut](../../source/buildings/fisher), [Guard Tower](../../source/buildings/guardtower), [Courier's Hut](../../source/buildings/courier), [Bakery](../../source/buildings/bakery), [Restaurant](../../source/buildings/restaurant), and more are probably good places to start. 

But you start with only 4 citizens! Now what? Well, the next step after your 4 citizens are employed and are working hard is to plan and place the [House](../../source/buildings/house). This will give you additional citizens for each level of a House you build in your colony (after your inital four citizens are housed)! Now, what do you do with so many citizens? You cannot assign more than 1 worker per hut. Therefore, consider building additional huts for more Miners, Foresters, Builders, Farmers, Fishers, and many more! 

**Hint:** Upgrade your huts to the highest level possible (level 5 for all of them except the [Tavern](../../source/buildings/tavern)) to get achievements (and increase the speed at which the worker [levels](../../source/systems/worker)).
