The Cook is the most important part of your colony's food production. The Cook will make steak, cooked pork, baked potatoes, cooked salmon, and other cooked food items to provide for all your citizens' food needs. If a citizen is hungry, they will come to the Restaurant and the Cook will give them some food.

The higher a Cook's Adaptability skill, the faster their food will cook. If they have a higher Knowledge skill, they have a greater chance to reduce the number of raw food items needed to produce one cooked item.
