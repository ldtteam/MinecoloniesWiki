The Quarrier is part of the resource production of your colony. The Quarrier will dig a quarry pit to collect larger amounts of stone type blocks.

The Quarrier will only break blocks according to the level of their pickaxe, and will only be able to use a tool according to the level of their miner's hut (check the [worker](../systems/worker) system page).

The Quarrier has a chance to get lucky in finding ores when digging out cobblestone or stone! This is the default setting in the [configuration file](../../source/misc/configfile), but you can change this.

The Quarrier's Strength level affects their block breaking speed. Similarly, their Stamina skill affects their block placing speed, so if they have a higher Stamina skill they'll place supports and other blocks faster.
