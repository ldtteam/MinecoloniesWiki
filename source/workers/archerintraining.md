Archers in Training will train at the Archery to become a [Guard](../../source/workers/guard). They will use a bow to shoot practice dummies and will level up without a risk of dying to mobs.

Archers in Training are not actual Guards even though they are dressed in the usual Guard clothes. They will *not* help defend your colony, only Guards will do that.
