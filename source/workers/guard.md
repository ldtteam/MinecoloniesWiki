Guards are the protecting force for your colony. As long as you provide a Guard with a weapon, they will protect your colony day and night. 

There are two types of Guards: Knights and Archers. Knights use swords, while Archers use bows. (Archers don't require arrows to shoot, unless you've completed the [research](../../source/systems/research) in the [University](../../source/buildings/university).) You can set the type of Guard in the [Guard Tower](../../source/buildings/guardtower) or [Barracks Tower](../../source/buildings/barrackstower) GUI.

Guards will use armor when provided with some, and, if they're a Knight, will use a shield as well (again, only if you've completed the research in the University).

The higher a Knight's Adaptability level, the faster their attack speed is. The higher their Stamina level, the more health they'll have.

The higher an Archer's Agility level, the more damage they'll do. The higher their Adaptability level, the greater their range will be.
