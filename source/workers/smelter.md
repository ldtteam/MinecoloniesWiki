The Smelter is a very important addition to help automate your colony. The Smelter will smelt ores into ingots for your colony's needs. The Smelter will require fuel to use in their furnace(s).

Smelters have a chance to double and even triple ores, depending on the Smeltery's level and the Smelter's Strength skill:

| Building Level | Normal Output | % Chance of Doubling Output | % Chance of Tripling Output |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| 1 | 100% | Strength Level | --- |
| 2 | 100% | 2 x Strength Level | --- |
| 3 | --- | 100% | --- |
| 4 | --- | 100% | Strength Level |
| 5 | --- | 100% | 2 x Strength Level |

The higher a Smelter's Athletics level, the faster their furnaces will smelt.
