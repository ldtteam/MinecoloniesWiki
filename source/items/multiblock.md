### The Block

The multiblock looks like a smooth andesite block, with a hole in each face. Crafting the multiblock requires 3 stone, 2 blocks of redstone, 3 pistons, and the build tool. 

<br>

### The GUI

Place the multiblock beside, above, or below the blocks you want to move. Then right click it to open the GUI.

<br>

You will see 4 blue arrows, a + and a - with Range: and Speed: in the center. The arrows refer to the cardinal directions, Up for North, Down for South, Right for East and Left for West. The + is to raise and the - is to lower.  The Range: is 10 blocks and The Speed: is 1-3, 3 being the fastest. 

You will need to left click on one of the arrows or +, or - and it will turn green. This shows the directions the blocks will move when activating the redstone. Then right click on another arrow or + or - for the direction the blocks will move when the redstone signal is off. (this is typically the location of where the blocks are currently in the build.)

**Note:** All blocks must be the same in order to work.

**Note:** There must be enough room for all the blocks to move or it will stop.
