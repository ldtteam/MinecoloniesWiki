The Gates are like large doors, but harder for raiders to break. Iron Gates take even longer than Wooden Gates for raiders to break, and there are a couple of [researches](../../source/systems/research) at the [university](../../source/buildings/university) to make them take *even longer.*

However, players and citizens can still use them as normal doors by right-clicking. They will also be triggered by redstone signals.

## Using the Gates

To place a Gate:
- Have several stacked in your inventory
- Right-click the stack where you want it to be placed
- The entire stack will be placed, filling as much space as it can

**Note:** The maximum size of a Gate is 5x4 blocks.

## Here are a few screenshots:
