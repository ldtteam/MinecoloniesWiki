Shingles are decorative roofing tiles for the tops of buildings. Shingles come in all wood types, including [cactus planks](../../source/items/cactusplanks), and many different colors. 

There is even a shingle half slab for the crown of the roof that comes in all the colors as well!

Shingles can be crafted at the [Sawmill](../../source/buildings/sawmill) and dyed at the [Dyer's Hut](../../source/buildings/dyer).

## Using Shingles

Use shingles like you would use stairs to create roofs for buildings.
