    There is no recipe for the Ancient Tome. It must be obtained in game.

### The Item

The Ancient Tome is a glowing book that can be dropped by the Barbarians during raids. They are a fairly rare drop though, so don't expect one to drop during every raid. The Ancient Tome cannot be crafted and is only available as a drop.

### Using the Ancient Tome

There are two uses for the Ancient Tome, one use for the player and one for the [Enchanter](../../source/workers/enchanter). The player's use is that if you have the Ancient Tome in your inventory, it will glow when there is going to be a raid that night. The Enchanter's use is to use the experience they collect from other workers to turn the Ancient Tome into a Book of Enchantment. When they do this, it will use up the Ancient Tome.
