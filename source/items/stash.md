The stash lets a player deposit items that they want to be picked up by a [Courier](../../source/workers/courier) to take to the [Warehouse](../../source/buildings/warehouse).

The stash can be crafted at the [Sawmill](../../source/buildings/sawmill) or by the player.

## Using the Stash

To use the stash, right-click on it to bring up the inventory, which works like a chest. Put items in the stash and a Courier from the nearest Warehouse will pick them up.
