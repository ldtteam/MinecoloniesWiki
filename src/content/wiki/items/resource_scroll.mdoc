The resource scroll is an easy way to tell what one of your {% worker name="builder" /%} needs. It's like a portable second page of the {% building name="builder" /%} !

## Using the Resource Scroll

When you first make the resource scroll, if you right-click anywhere you will get a message to sneak + right-click on a {% building name="builder" /%} to register the resource scroll.

Now when you right-click while holding the resource scroll, you will see all the needed materials for the {% building name="builder" /%} you clicked on. Each needed item is displayed, along with how many of that item is in the hut's inventory, and how many are needed. These amounts will change as the {% worker name="builder" /%} places blocks and will show only what blocks the {% worker name="builder" /%} still needs to place. The blocks in black are in their inventory. The blocks in red are the ones neither you nor the {% worker name="builder" /%} has in their inventory. The blocks in green are ones you have in inventory but the {% worker name="builder" /%} needs. Yellow blocks means you have some of the necessary resource, but not enough.

If you go to a {% building name="warehouse" /%} and right-click the resource scroll on the Warehouse hut, the resource scroll will show you how many of each item is currently stored in that Warehouse. This will be in green to the far right of each block.
