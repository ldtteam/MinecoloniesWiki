The Florist is a specialist of your colony's production. The Florist will grow flowers in [compost blocks](../../source/items/compost). For them to do this, they require [compost](../../source/items/compost) and an axe.

The higher a Florist's Dexterity level, the greater the chance for them to successfully harvest a flower. The higher their Agility level is, the less time it'll take for new flowers to grow.
