The Quarry is where you can hire a {% worker name="quarrier" /%} to dig the quarry. The Quarry will be a pit of varied size (simple quarry is 1 x 1 chunks, medium is 2 x 2) to collect larger amounts of stone type blocks.  The Quarry will only produce the blocks it digs out.  It will not produce additional ore blocks like the {% building name="miner" /%}.

> **Note:** You must first hire a {% worker name="quarrier" /%} at a {% building name="miner" /%} before assigning them to a Quarry.
