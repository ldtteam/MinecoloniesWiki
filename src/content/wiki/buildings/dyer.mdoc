The {% building /%} is where the {% worker /%} will craft dyes and dye other items, including red nether bricks and dark prismarine. They won't dye concrete or concrete powder, though. The {% worker /%} will only do this if they receive a request from another worker and have the necessary materials. The {% building /%} automatically knows how to make green dye and red sand, but you must teach it the recipes for the other dyes and the dyed items.

> **Note:** Upgrading the {% building /%} lets you teach it more recipes. So:

| Building Level | Number of Recipes |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| 1              | 10                |
| 2              | 20                |
| 3              | 40                |
| 4              | 80                |
| 5              | 160               |

> **Note:** The higher the level of the {% building /%}, the more furnaces the {% worker /%} will have available. The number of furnaces they *use* depends on their Creativity level. So:

| Building Level | Furnaces |
| -------------- | -------- |
| 1              | 1        |
| 2              | 2        |
| 3              | 3        |
| 4              | 4        |
| 5              | 5        |

> **Note:** The higher the {% worker /%} their Dexterity level, the faster things will smelt. At high levels, they can go *much* faster than the player!

- **Recipe Mode:** This is unlocked by researching {% research_link name="warehousemaster" /%} in the {% building name="university" /%}. This changes how multiple recipes for the same item are prioritized.
  - **Priority:** This is the default setting. The hut will try to use recipes that are higher up in their recipe list first.
  - **Warehouse Stock:** The hut will look in the warehouse first to see what resource you have more of before deciding what recipe it will use.
