The {% building /%} is the ultimate protection for your colony. Each {% building /%} can hold multiple {% building name="barrackstower" /%} within its structure. The {% building name="barrackstower" /%} (unlike the normal {% building name="guardtower" /%}) will employ *and* house one Guard for every level built, for a total of 5 Guards per {% building name="barrackstower" /%}! Each new Guard will need a bed in a {% building name="residence" /%} in order to spawn. However, once they are hired at the {% building name="barrackstower" /%}, that becomes their new residence and the bed in the house will open up for another new citizen. Currently, all official-style {% building /%} contain 4 {% building name="barrackstower" /%} for a total of 20 Guards per {% building /%} for your colony. However, custom styles can have more or fewer than 4 {% building name="barrackstower" /%}. Colonists like feeling safe, so building {% building /%} close to colonists' work and homes can improve their [happiness](/wiki/systems/happinessandsaturation).
