The {% building /%} is where the {% worker name="composter" /%} will turn organic materials into {% item name="compost_barrel" /%} to make compost or dirt.

**Hint:** The higher the level of the {% building /%}, the more compost barrels the {% worker name="composter" /%} will be able to use. So:

| Building Level | Compost Barrels |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| 1              | 1               |
| 2              | 2               |
| 3              | 3               |
| 4              | 4               |
| 5              | 5               |
