### Before you build *any* other building, you must build the {% building /%}. If the {% building /%} is not built, the {% worker /%} cannot build other buildings.

Before you choose a place to build the {% building /%}, take into account the distances among the other possible building sites and obstacles like water, trees, caves, mountains, lava sources, etc. After you have selected a place for the hut, you have to craft the {% building /%} block and place it with your {% item name="structurize/build_tool" /%}. Once the hut is placed, the {% worker /%} will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best [traits](/wiki/systems/worker) for a {% worker /%} if you changed this in the settings tab in the {% building name="townhall" /%}).

Now you will have to issue the build assignment so the {% worker /%} can build their own hut first. The {% worker /%} will ask for the materials they need. Make sure to check the {% item name="minecolonies/resource_scroll" /%} or the Required Resources tab of the {% building /%} GUI to see what materials the {% worker /%} is requesting for any build/upgrade. Any material in the list that is still missing will be in red letters.

Once the {% building /%} is built you can now build anything you want, like worker huts, buildings, decorations, or your own schematics.

- **Note:** The {% worker /%} can only build or upgrade any other hut up to the level of their own hut. So, in order for the {% worker /%} to upgrade any building, the {% building /%} must be upgraded first. Then the {% worker /%} will be able to upgrade any other building(s).

### Hints and Tips

For the placement of the {% building /%}, you should consider having the hut in the middle of where you plan to have the rest of your buildings so that the {% worker /%} has less of a distance to walk between their hut and the build sites.

The {% worker /%} will not start another build assignment until they have finished the current one.

You can go into the {% building name="townhall" /%} it's GUI and click on the work orders tab to cancel builds as well as arrange the priorities of the other build orders you have there. If you cancel a work order and it was being built already, if you assign the build order again, the {% worker /%} will continue where they left off.

If the {% worker /%} removes a block while building and/or upgrading, they will keep it in their inventory and dump any items in their inventory at the end of a build into the {% building /%} inventory.

## Interface

{% building_gui_content_block_main order=1 /%}
{% building_gui_content_block_crafting_recipes order=2 /%}
{% building_gui_content_block_required_resources order=3 /%}
{% building_gui_content_block_settings order=4 %}
- **Task Assignment Mode:** Here you can set your {% worker /%} to Manual or Automatic mode (Automatic by default).
  - **Automatic:** The {% worker /%} chooses which build order they'll complete next themselves (based on the order of the build requests in the {% building name="townhall" /%} GUI's work orders tab).
  - **Manual:** You choose their next build order yourself by clicking Select next to the build order's name.
- **Recipe Mode:** This is unlocked by researching {% research_link name="warehousemaster" /%} in the {% building name="university" /%}. This changes how multiple recipes for the same item are prioritized.
  - **Priority:** This is the default setting. The hut will try to use recipes that are higher up in their recipe list first.
  - **Warehouse Stock:** The hut will look in the {% building name="warehouse" /%} first to see what resource you have more of before deciding what recipe it will use.
- **Construction Strategy:** This is unlocked by researching {% research_link name="buildermodes" /%} in the {% building name="university" /%}. This allows you to change how the {% worker /%} builds, reducing pathfinding and speeding up builds (especially on large builds). Any one of these can be set in the [Structurize](/wiki/dependencies/structurize) config, but once the {% research_link name="buildermodes" /%} research is done in the {% building name="university" /%}, the one set here takes precedence.
  - **Default:** The default row-by-row pattern.
  - **Hilbert:** Hilbert does [this pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve), with a little difference to work for rectangular areas.
  - **Inward Circle:** Blocks are placed like a square spiral from the outside in.
  - **Inward Circle Height 1-4**: Same as `inwardcircle`, but configurable to go X amount of blocks up as well.
  - **Random:** Blocks are placed in an entirely random order. Note that this slows down builds.
- **Use Shears:** Whether the {% worker /%} will use shears to harvest certain blocks like leaves or grass.
- **Fill Block:** Here you can select what block the {% worker /%} uses to fill in holes/gaps in the schematic. The default is the dirt block.
