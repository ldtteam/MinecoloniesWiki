The Mine is where you can hire a {% worker name="miner" /%} to work the mine, or a {% worker name="quarrier" /%} to work the {% building name="quarry" /%}. If you hire a Quarrier, there will be no Miner at this Mine. 

{% version name="1.20.1" after=true %}
At the {% building /%}, the {% worker name="miner" /%} will mine for ores and materials. Once they are hired, they will first create a shaft downward.

The {% worker name="miner" /%} digs their shaft down until to the first mining level below it, increasing one further for each building level past 1.

These mining levels are based on the ores you can find there most:
| Ore     | Y-level |
| ------- | ------- |
| Copper  | 48      |
| Iron    | 16      |
| Gold    | -16     |
| Diamond | Bedrock |

To give some examples:
If the miner builds their first platform at Y 48 or above:
- Level 1 can dig down to Y 48
- Level 2 can dig down to Y 16
- Level 3 can dig down to Y -16
- Etc

If the miner builds their first platform between Y 48 and Y 16:
- Level 1 can dig down to Y 16
- Level 2 can dig down to Y -16
- Level 3 can dig down to bedrock

Once the main shaft is completed, the {% worker name="miner" /%} will then branch out.
{% /version %}
{% version name="1.20" before=true %}
At the {% building /%}, the {% worker name="miner" /%} will mine for ores and materials. Once they are hired, they will first create a shaft downward to a specific depth depending on the level of the {% building /%}. Once the main shaft is completed, the {% worker name="miner" /%} will then branch out.
{% /version %}
The miner will never dig further down than the Y-level specified in the "maximum depth" setting of the mine. It is by default set to -100, which effectively means bedrock level.


While mining, sometimes the {% worker name="miner" /%} will get lucky and get an ore block instead of a basic stone block. The chance of getting "Lucky Ores" is set in the [config](/wiki/misc/configfile).

> **Note:** When the miner encounters air whilst building the shaft downwards, they don't make platforms there, as they think they encountered a cave. In particular, that means you should not help them with mining. Even though they skip platforms, they still check the Y-level against the depth threshold and stop digging down if they aren't allowed to dig down further.
{% version name="1.20" before=true %}
> **Note:** Placing the Mine hut below the maximum Y level it can mine will cause the {% worker name="miner" /%} not work and complain the hut needs to be upgraded.  To avoid this error, place the hut at least 4 blocks above the maximum depth for the hut level (above Y=54 for 1.16 or Y=44 for 1.18 level 1).  If you want your mine to be lower, you will need to upgrade it before the miner will work.

The level refers to the platforms the {% worker name="miner" /%} will place every 3 blocks down. Here you can assign what level of the {% building /%} the {% worker name="miner" /%} will create their mineshafts (nodes).
If a level has a red number next to it, that means the {% worker name="miner" /%} is currently mining that level.
The {% worker name="miner" /%} will ignore orders to mine at a specific level until the entire mineshaft is completed to the maximum depth their hut's level allows.
You can also click Repair, to tell the {% worker name="miner" /%} to restore that level to its original state. This can be useful if a fire breaks out in the mineshaft.

{% building_gui_content_block_custom order=7 header="guards" imageKey="guards" imageAlt="Guards" %}
Here is where you can assign guards to patrol this {% building /%}. If assigned, they will patrol the level the {% worker name="miner" /%} is currently mining at, to help protect them from hostile mobs.
Only guards set to the Patrol Mine task will show up here; tasks can be set in the {% building name="guardtower" /%} it's GUI ({% building name="barrackstower" plural=true /%} do not have the Patrol Mine task).

The amount of guards you can assign to the mine changes based on the {% building /%} it's level.

| Building Level | Amount of guards |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1              | 1                |
| 2              | 1                |
