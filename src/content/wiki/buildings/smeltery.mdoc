The {% building /%} is where the {% worker /%} will smelt ores into ingots.

{% version range="1.19--" %}
The primary skill level of the {% worker /%} will determine how many furnaces they will be able to use, up to a maximum of 10.
The {% worker /%} applies fortune to the ores they smelt. The fortune level is building level -1 (for example, a level 3 {% worker /%}, will apply fortune II).
{% /version %}
{% version range="--1.18.2" %}
The higher the level of the {% building /%}, the more furnaces the {% worker /%} will be able to use.
A higher level will also have a higher chance to double and even triple the ingot output per block of ore.

Listed here are all ore blocks the {% building /%} can smelt. Turn off any ores you do not want smelted.
All coded ores (even if they come from other mods) are automatically added to this list.
If you have ores that are not on the list, they can be added to the [config file](/wiki/misc/configfile).
