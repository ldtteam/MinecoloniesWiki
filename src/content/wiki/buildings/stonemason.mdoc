The {% building /%} is where the {% worker /%} will craft 3x3 recipes made entirely out of cobblestone, stone, andesite, diorite, granite, quartz, purpur, nether bricks, prismarine, sandstones, blackstone, basalt, and/or ores (no ingots or redstone items). They can also craft end stone from cobblestone and an ender pearl, but only if you have completed the Know the End [research](/wiki/systems/research) in the {% building name="university" /%}. The {% worker /%} will only work when they receive a request from another worker and have the needed materials. You will also need to teach the {% building /%} the recipes you want the {% worker /%} to craft.

> **Note:** Upgrading the {% building /%} lets you teach it more recipes. So:

| Building Level | Number of Recipes |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| 1              | 10                |
| 2              | 20                |
| 3              | 40                |
| 4              | 80                |
| 5              | 160               |

## Interface

{% building_gui_content_block_main order=1 /%}
{% building_gui_content_block_crafting_recipes order=2 /%}

- **Recipe Mode:** This is unlocked by researching {% research_link name="warehousemaster" /%} in the {% building name="university" /%}. This changes how multiple recipes for the same item are prioritized.
  - **Priority:** This is the default setting. The hut will try to use recipes that are higher up in their recipe list first.
  - **Warehouse Stock:** The hut will look in the warehouse first to see what resource you have more of before deciding what recipe it will use.
