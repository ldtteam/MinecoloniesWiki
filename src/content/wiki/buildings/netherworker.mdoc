{% building_infobox name="netherworker" %}
The Nether Mine is where the {% worker_link name="netherminer" /%} works. The Nether Miner travels into the Nether and mines resources found there.  The level of the hut determines what items Nether Miner brings back.

- **Level 1:**  blaze rod, ender pearl, ghast tear, gold ingot, gold nugget, gravel, gunpowder, leather, magma cream, nether quartz ore, netherrack, porkchop, rotten flesh, soul sand, soul_soil.
- **Level 2:**  All items from previous levels, plus brown mushroom, crimson fungus, crimson nylium, crimson stem, glowstone, nether wart, red mushroom.
- **Level 3:**  All items from previous levels, plus basalt, warped fungus, warped nylium, warped_stem.
- **Level 4:**  All items from previous levels, plus blackstone, nether gold ore.
- **Level 5:**  All items from previous levels, plus ancient debris.

The Nether Miner can also craft lava buckets.

**Note:** The portal in the Nether Mine will transport players to the Nether. However, the Nether Miner does not actually travel into the Nether, nor do they actually mine any blocks in the Nether.
