The Flower Shop is where your Florist will grow flowers for your colony, if given {% item name="compost" /%} and an axe.

**Hint:** The higher the level of the Flower Shop, the more daily output the Florist can handle. So:

| Building Level | Number of Plants |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1              | 4                |
| 2              | 8                |
| 3              | 12               |
| 4              | 16               |
| 5              | 20               |

## {% building /%} GUI

{% building_gui_content_block_main order=1 /%}
{% building_gui_content_block_item_list order=2 header="plantables" imageKey="plantables" imageAlt="Plantables list" defaultOn=true %}
This shows a list of items the {% worker name="florist" /%} can plant. As the {% building /%} is leveled up, your {% building /%} will be able to grow more types of flowers. At level 3 or higher, you will be able to select which flowers you want to use, before that it can only grow poppies and dandelions.
