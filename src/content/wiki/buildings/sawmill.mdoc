The {% building /%} is where the {% worker /%} will craft any items made of at least 75% wood that do not include ingots, stone, redstone (or produce a redstone signal), or string. The {% worker /%} will also craft a few other items, including {% item name="minecolonies/blockminecoloniesrack" /%}, as well as [Domum Ornamentum](/wiki/dependencies/domumornamentum) blocks that include wood. For them to do this, you must teach the {% building /%} the recipes and the {% worker /%} must receive a request for an item from another worker.

> **Note:** Upgrading the {% building /%} lets you teach it more recipes. So:

| Building Level | Number of Recipes |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| 1              | 10                |
| 2              | 20                |
| 3              | 40                |
| 4              | 80                |
| 5              | 160               |

- **Recipe Mode:** This is unlocked by researching {% research_link name="warehousemaster" /%} in the {% building name="university" /%}. This changes how multiple recipes for the same item are prioritized.
  - **Priority:** This is the default setting. The hut will try to use recipes that are higher up in their recipe list first.
  - **Warehouse Stock:** The hut will look in the warehouse first to see what resource you have more of before deciding what recipe it will use.
