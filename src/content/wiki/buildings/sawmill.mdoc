The Sawmill is where the Carpenter will craft any items made of at least 75% wood that do not include ingots, stone, redstone (or produce a redstone signal), or string. The Carpenter will also craft a few other items, including [compost barrels](../../source/items/compostbarrel) and [racks](../../source/items/rack), as well as [Domum Ornamentum](../../source/dependencies/domumornamentum) blocks that include wood. For them to do this, you must teach the Sawmill the recipes and the Carpenter must receive a request for an item from another worker.

**Hint:** The number of recipes you can teach the Sawmill doubles per building level. So:

| Sawmill Level | Number of Recipes |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 1             | 10                |
| 2             | 20                |
| 3             | 40                |
| 4             | 80                |
| 5             | 160               |
