The {% building /%} will employ and house one Guard to protect your colony. The new guard will need a bed in a house in order to spawn. However, once they are hired at the {% building /%}, that becomes their new home and the bed in their original home will open up for another new citizen (child or recruit). Citizens like feeling safe, so building {% building plural=true /%} close to colonists' work and homes can improve their [happiness](/wiki/systems/happinessandsaturation). Additionally, if you place {% building plural=true /%} near your colony border and level them up, your border will [expand](/wiki/systems/border).

The guard will patrol a set distance around their building, which is based on their building its level.

| Building Level | Max Patrol Distance |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| 1              | 80 blocks           |
| 2              | 110 blocks          |
| 3              | 140 blocks          |
| 4              | 170 blocks          |
| 5              | 200 blocks          |

- **Retreat on low health:** Here you can choose if the Guard will attempt to retreat when they have low health.
- **Hire Trainee:** If there is a vacancy at this tower, a new {% worker name="knight" /%} or {% worker name="archer" /%} can be hired from the respective training facility ({% building name="combatacademy" /%} for {% worker name="knight" plural=true /%} and {% building name="archery" /%} for {% worker name="archer" /%}) instead of an unemployed colonist.
