The {% building /%} is where the {% worker /%} will breed, butcher, and milk (if you have the option enabled) cows for food and leather. You will have to capture and bring in two cows to the {% building /%}, as the {% worker /%} will not catch and bring in any cows.

> **Note:** The {% worker /%} will only keep two cows alive per hut level, so at level 5 they will have 10 cows in their holding pens to breed and butcher. This means they will be faster at producing and collecting meat and leather. So:


| Building Level | Cows Housed |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| 1              | 2           |
| 2              | 4           |
| 3              | 6           |
| 4              | 8           |
| 5              | 10          |
