The {% building /%} is like a {% building name="residence" /%} in that it houses citizens, however, the {% building /%} houses four instead of one and can't be upgraded to house more.

Every so often, visitors will come to the {% building /%}. You can recruit these visitors (with items) to live and work in your colony. Don't attack them, they'll fight back!
Upgrading the {% building /%} will garner more and better visitors.

> **Note:** The {% building /%} can only be upgraded to level 3, not level 5. You can also only have **one** {% building /%} per colony.
