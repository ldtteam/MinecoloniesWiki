The {% building /%} is where the {% worker name="fisher" /%} will catch fish. The {% worker name="fisher" /%} requires a fishing rod and a body of water of a minimum of {% meta key="fisher_pond_size" /%} to be able to work, and the water must be near the hut.

Upgrading the {% building /%} will expand the range at which the {% worker name="fisher" /%} can fish, and the higher the level of the {% building /%}, the more loot the {% worker name="fisher" /%} will be fishing out (instead of fish). This includes prismarine and sponges!

> **Note:** The {% worker name="fisher" /%} will only catch fish and junk in most biomes. If the {% worker name="fisher" /%} is in an ocean biome, items from treasure category will also be caught.
