The {% building /%} is a way for you to raise your adult citizens their Intelligence skill, which influences all other skill increases (at other jobs). A citizen will randomly level up their Intelligence as long as they're assigned to the {% building /%}. Being a {% worker /%} is their full-time job, so you can't have one citizen work at the {% building /%} and another worker hut at the same time.

Two citizens can study per building level. So: 

| Building Level | Citizens Educated at a Time |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1              | 2                           |
| 2              | 4                           |
| 3              | 6                           |
| 4              | 8                           |
| 5              | 10                          |

> **Note:** Paper and books help {% worker plural=true /%} increase their skills faster.
