The Glassblower's Hut is where the Glassblower will smelt sand into glass and make glass panes from glass blocks. For the Glassblower to work, they must receive a request from another worker and have the necessary materials, including fuel if they're smelting sand into glass. The Glassblower's Hut must also have been taught the crafting recipe for glass panes.

**Hint:** The number of recipes you can teach the Glassblower's Hut doubles per building level. So:

| Glassblower's Hut Level | Number of Recipes |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1                       | 10                |
| 2                       | 20                |
| 3                       | 40                |
| 4                       | 80                |
| 5                       | 160               |

**Hint:** The higher the level of the Glassblower's Hut, the more furnaces the Glassblower will have available. The number of furnaces they *use* depends on their Creativity level. So:

| Building Level | Furnaces |
| -------------- | -------- |
| 1              | 1        |
| 2              | 2        |
| 3              | 3        |
| 4              | 4        |
| 5              | 5        |

**Hint:** The higher the Glassblower's Focus level, the faster things will smelt. At high levels, they can go *much* faster than the player!
