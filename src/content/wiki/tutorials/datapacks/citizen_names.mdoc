## Citizen names

Citizen names can be changed via a datapack. For the ones already in the mod, you can look it [on Github](https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies/blob/version/main/src/main/resources/data/minecolonies/citizennames).
The default.json file is loaded by default, patreons have a button in the town hall to change to any of the other ones in data packs in the `citizennames` data location.

There are also sample data packs on the [citizen names](/wiki/misc/custom_citizen_names) page

The citizen name files have the following components:

| Key Name           | Type             | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `parts`            | Integer          | `2` or `3`. This determines whether a middle letter is used in the name (if it is 3) |
| `order`            | String           | `"WESTERN"` or `"EASTERN"`. In case of EASTERN, the surname is shown first           |
| `male_firstname`   | Array of Strings | A list of the male first names                                                       |
| `female_firstname` | Array of Strings | A list of the female first names                                                     |
| `surnames`         | Array of Strings | A list of the surnames for the citizens                                              |
