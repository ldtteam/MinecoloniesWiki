While Item Tags determine the recipes that workers can be taught, colonists can also automatically learn special **Crafter Recipes**. These recipes can be different than those available to the player or even reflect items that can't be made in any other way. Unlike Tags, Crafter Recipes can and must hold a large number of properties, some containing arrays or objects of properties themselves. Supported properties include: 

| Crafter Recipe Key Name      | Type             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `recipe-id-to-remove`        | String           | A Resource Location of a different crafter recipe to remove, preventing buildings from learning it. Requires `"type":"remove"`. All other properties are ignored. Example: `"recipe-id-to-remove": "minecolonies:blacksmith/platearmorchestplate"`.           |

On existing worlds, removing a Crafter Recipe through data packs will automatically remove it from existed constructed buildings that have learned it.

For example crafter recipes, and their canonical names, see GitHub [here](https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies/tree/version/main/src/main/resources/data/minecolonies/crafterrecipes) and [here](https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies/tree/version/main/src/datagen/generated/minecolonies/data/minecolonies/crafterrecipes).

## Player Recipes

**Player Recipes** can be added by data packs using vanilla features, by adding to the `recipes` Data Location. See the [Official Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Recipe) for details, and the [GitHub for MineColonies default recipes](https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies/tree/version/main/src/main/resources/data/minecolonies/recipes).
