![Sleep](@assets/images/wiki/misc/sleep.png) **If it is raining, snowing, nighttime, or a citizen died yesterday (in-game time), your citizens will stop working!**

## Traits
When hiring a worker at a hut, the primary trait used in that work will be highlighted in **green** and the secondary trait in **yellow** to help you decide which citizen is the best worker for the job. The higher a worker's skill, the faster and more efficient they will be. Each trait also has a specific bonus for the job. To see these bonuses, please visit the worker pages.

Workers their skills increase as they work. They are limited by the level of the worker's home. The level of a worker's work hut and their Intelligence skill level affect the speed that they level up.

| Home Level | Max Skill Level |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| 0          | 10              |
| 1          | 20              |
| 2          | 30              |
| 3          | 40              |

## Tool / Sword Levels

The type of tools/swords workers can use depends on the level of a worker's work hut.
Note that each enchantment level counts as 1 enchantment.
For example, Unbreaking II counts as 2 enchantments, Efficiency V counts as 5 enchantments, and a tool with both Unbreaking II and Efficiency I counts as having 3 enchantments.
