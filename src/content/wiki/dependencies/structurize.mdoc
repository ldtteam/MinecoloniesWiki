Structurize is a dependency of MineColonies which handles the construction of schematics (blueprints).

The primary tool to do this is the {% item name="build_tool" /%}, which we go further in depth in the page about the build tool.

There are 3 other tools that are used in schematic creation:
- {% item name="scan_tool" /%}
- {% item name="tag_tool" /%}
- {% item name="shape_tool" /%}

For more information about creating schematics, please visit [this page](/wiki/tutorials/schematics)
