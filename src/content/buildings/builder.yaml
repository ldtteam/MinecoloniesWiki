name: Builder's Hut
plural: Builder Huts
workers:
  - builder
recipes:
  - blockhutbuilder
settings:
  - name: Builder Mode
    description: Here you can set your Builder to Manual or Automatic mode (Automatic by default). In Automatic, the builder chooses which build order they'll complete next themselves (based on the order of the build requests in the {% building name="townhall" /%} GUI's work orders tab). In Manual, you choose their next build order yourself by clicking Select next to the build order's name.
  - name: Recipe Mode
    description: This is unlocked by researching Warehouse Master in the University. This changes how multiple recipes for the same item are prioritized.
    options:
      - name: Priority
        description: This is the default setting. The hut will try to use recipes that are higher up in their recipe list first.
      - name: Warehouse Stock
        description: The hut will look in the warehouse first to see what resource you have more of before deciding what recipe it will use.
  - name: Build Method
    description: This is unlocked by researching Builder Modes in the University. This allows you to change how the builder builds, reducing pathfinding and speeding up builds (especially large builds). Any one of these can be set in the structurize config, but once the "Builder Modes" research is done in the university, the one set here takes precedence.
    options:
      - name: Default
        description: The default row-by-row pattern.
      - name: inwardcircle
        description: Blocks are placed like a square spiral from the outside in.
      - name: inwardcircleheight#
        description: This will also make spirals from the outside in, but each spiral gets built upward 1 to 4 times, before the builder will start the next square inward.
      - name: hilbert
        description: hilbert does [this pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve){:target="_blank"}, with a little difference to work for rectangular areas.
      - name: random
        description: Blocks are placed in an entirely random order. Note that this slows down builds.
  - name: Use Shears
    description: Whether the {% worker name="builder" /%} will use shears to harvest certain blocks like leaves or grass.
  - name: Fill Block
    description: Here you can select what block the builder uses to fill in holes/gaps in the schematic. The default is the dirt block.
