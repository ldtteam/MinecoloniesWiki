        type: primitive
        primitive:
          - string
        description: A specific building to be added to the list of alternate-buildings. At least one of the alternate-buildings must be present in the colony to begin research. Optionally pairs with `level`. Acts like `building` if only one alternate-building object is present.
        example: library
        optional: true
      - key: level
        type: primitive
        primitive:
          - integer
        description: Specifies a building level. Pairs with `building`, `mandatory-building`, and `alternate-building`, otherwise has no effect.

      - key: research
        type: primitive
        primitive:
          - string
        description: A specific research by Resource Location that must be completed to unlock this research. Unlike, `parentResearch`, can be on another branch, or of any research level.
        example: "minecolonies:civilian/outposts"
        optional: true
  - key: effects
    type: array
    description: Contains all of the effects of the research. Can be empty, either for research with no effects or for research that only unlocks crafterrecipes, or contain one or more objects.
    optional: true
    children:
      - key: "<effect key>"
        type: primitive
        primitive:
          - integer
        description: The Research Effect identifier as a Resource Location, followed by the level of the effect as an Integer. If the level exceeds the maximum level of the effect, defaults to the maximum level. If no matching effect is found, applies a default strength of 6, enough to unlock a building completely.
        example: 3
        default: 1
  - key: remove
    type: primitive
    primitive:
      - string
      - boolean
    description: "Removes a research branch, and all research on that branch, regardless of the source. May cause data loss if applied to an existing world.\n - String: Removes any research matching the Resource Location in that String.\n - Boolean (true): Removes research matching the Resource Location of the JSON itself; this form is discouraged for cases where other data packs may apply, as it may be conflicted by those other data packs."
