    MineColonies is an interactive building mod that allows you to create your own thriving town within Minecraft. It
    lets your leadership skills soar by providing you with everything you need to build your kingdom. MineColonies gives
    you the flexibility to create a colony as unique as every player. With so many options, you'll create a different
    colony every time, adapt it to any biome, build inside a mountain, on top of one, under the ocean, or in the sky.
