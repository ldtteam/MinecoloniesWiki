    </p>

    <h3>Governance</h3>
    <p>
      You have full control of how to build your Town. You determine how many workers you want or need, what type of
      workers, where they will live, and hire or fire as you see fit. Creating a Town at your own pace. It is your Town
      to design and develop, you are the designer, administrator and boss.
    </p>

    <h3>Security and Replenishment</h3>
    <p>
      Your Town deserves the best security you can have. Strategically add Guard Towers or Tower Barracks to protect
      your Town from hostile mobs and barbarians that will attack on random nights. Give them the best weapons and
      armour your Town has to offer. They need to be fed well to work and protect it better. Keep a busy farmer to
      supply the baker and the cook at the restaurant, so no one goes hungry.
    </p>

    <h3>Have fun, Play with Friends</h3>
    <p>
      Minecolonies has a very powerful multiplayer system and an awesome tool for learning about Town planning, building
      and especially management. The permission system allows for collaborative team play in multiplayer where you can
      assign different roles in a Town such as; Officer, Friend, Neutral or even Hostile! Also have individual competing
      colonies at the same time, all with a strong protection system for server management and Anti-Griefing. Fun for
      all!
