MineColonies adds one new enchantment, Raider's Bane. It can be applied to weapons (swords and axes) and increases the weapon's damage against MineColonies raiders.
It goes up to level 2 and can be obtained from the {% worker name="enchanter" /%} when their {% building name="enchanter" /%} is level 3+. 
(For them to obtain a level 2 Raider's Bane enchant, their hut must be level 5.)
