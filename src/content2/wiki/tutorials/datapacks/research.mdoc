The [Research System](/wiki/systems/research) used by the {% building name="university" /%}  can be lightly tweaked or heavily modified through the use of data packs in MineColonies versions 0.14.0 or higher. For the default research data and example files, see [the GitHub](https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies/tree/version/main/src/datagen/generated/minecolonies/data/minecolonies/researches).
Researches consist of three components: the branch that contains the research, the research itself, and the research effect.

### Branches

Branches are the groups of research, such as "Civilian" or "Combat". Branch files must contain one of `"branch-name"` or `"base-time"`.

| Branch Key Name | Type                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `branch-type`   | String                                | An override for more specialized research branches. For now, `"unlockables"` disables research level checks. Otherwise, sets to default behavior. Optional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `base-time`     | double                                | A numeric multiplier applied to research time for all researches on the branch. Larger numbers take more time; lower numbers take less time. Very low values may make time estimates in-accurate. Defaults to 1.0; numbers below 0.0 or above 10 may behave poorly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `sortOrder`     | Integer                               | Controls the vertical position of the branch on the {% building name="university" /%} GUI. Lower numbers are placed first on the list, while higher numbers are placed closer to the bottom of the list. Optional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `hidden`        | Boolean                               | If true, and if all primary researches on the branch are hidden, prevents access to the branch from the {% building name="university" /%} window. If `"branch-type"` is set to `"unlockables"`, also prevents display of the branch; otherwise, provides a tooltip describing how unlock the branch's primary researches. Optional, defaults to false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `remove`        | Boolean or String or Array of Strings | Removes a research branch, and all research on that branch, regardless of the source. May cause data loss if applied to an existing world. If a String, removes all research with a branch of the Resource Location in that String. If an array of Strings, removes all researches for all researches with branches matching any of the Resource Locations. If Boolean and true, removes all Researches with branches matching the Resource Location of the JSON itself; this form is discouraged for cases where other data packs may apply, as it may be conflicted by those other data packs. |

### Research

Researches are the individual components of a branch. Branches must have at least one present research to be displayed to the user.

If Boolean and true, removes Research matching the Resource Location of the JSON itself; this form is discouraged for cases where other data packs may apply, as it may be conflicted by those other data packs. |

### Research Effects

Research Effects describe the actual impact and strength of that impact on the colony, players, or colonists. All Research Effects have an automatically generated effect strength 0 at level 0. If no other levels are defined, defaults to level one having a strength of 5, enough to unlock all levels of a building.

### MineColonies Building Unlocks

Research Effects may also optionally unlock a building. These reserved resource Locations will limit, and a research using the effect is loaded.
The strength of the effect determines the maximum level of upgrade that can be requested for the building: an effect of strength 1 would allow only level 1 buildings, while strength 2 would allow upgrades to level 2, and so forth.
They do not validate that these unlocks are reasonable, or even that they do not require the building that they unlock.
