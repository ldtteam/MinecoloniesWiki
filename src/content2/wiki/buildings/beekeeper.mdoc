The {% building /%} is where the {% worker /%} works. The {% worker /%} breeds bees and harvests honeycombs or honey bottles (you can
choose which on the second page of the {% building /%}'s GUI).

The level of the {% building /%} determines the max number of hives the {% worker /%} can take care of:

| Building Level | Max Number of Hives |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| 1              | 1                   |
| 2              | 2                   |
| 3              | 4                   |
| 4              | 8                   |
| 5              | 16                  |

> **Note:** If the {% worker /%} is asking for hives but there are some nearby, make sure you've set the hives for them to
take care of with the hive tool. This tool is accessed from the second page of the {% building /%} GUI (see below).
