The {% building /%} will craft bread dough, cookie dough, cake dough, and raw pumpkin pie, then bake these in a furnace to create bread, cookies, cakes, and pumpkin pies. They will only do this upon request, whether from the {% worker name="cook" /%}, the {% item name="postbox" /%}, or as a minimum stock in the {% building name="warehouse" /%}.

The {% worker /%} can also craft some non-vanilla breads:

- Sweet bread, made from wheat and a honey bottle. Available at {% building /%} level 3. Has slightly higher saturation than normal bread, also gives you a speed boost and removes poison.
- Milk-infused bread, made from wheat and a milk bucket. Available at {% building /%} level 4. Removes all potion effects (like milk buckets do).
- Golden bread, made from wheat and a gold ingot. Available at {% building /%} level 5. Instantly heals 2 hearts.
- Chorus bread, made from wheat and a chorus fruit. Available after completing the Know the End research in the {% building name="university" /%}. Has higher saturation than normal bread and teleports you to the surface after eating it.
