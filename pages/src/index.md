# Welcome to the MineColonies Wiki!

MineColonies is an interactive building mod that allows you to create your own thriving town within Minecraft. It lets your leadership skills soar by providing you with everything you need to build your kingdom. MineColonies gives you the flexibility to create a colony as unique as every player. With so many options, youâ€™ll create a different colony every time, adapt it to any biome, build inside a mountain, on top of one, under the ocean, or in the sky.

The limit is your imagination!

MineColonies features NPC workers such as [Builders](../../source/workers/builder), [Farmers](../../source/workers/farmer), [Fishers](../../source/workers/fisher), [Foresters](../../source/workers/forester), [Miners](../../source/workers/miner), [Smelters](../../source/workers/smelter), [Bakers](../../source/workers/baker), [Cooks](../../source/workers/cook), [Couriers](../../source/workers/courier), five types of animal herders, [Composters](../../source/workers/composter), and many more, with even more being developed and added as the mod grows.

It also includes specialized buildings such as the [Warehouse](../../source/buildings/warehouse), [House](../../source/buildings/house), [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall), [Barracks](../../source/buildings/barracks), [Library](../../source/buildings/library), [University](../../source/buildings/university), and even the [School](../../source/buildings/school).

### Please note that the wiki is a work in progress and will usually refer to the latest 1.18.2 and&#47;or 1.19.2 alpha version of MineColonies!
