### Note: The Concrete Mixer's Hut cannot be built until you have a level 1 {% building_link crusher %} and have finished the [research](../../source/systems/research) in the {% building_link university %}.
<br>

The Concrete Mixer will craft all types of concrete powder and place them in flowing water (built in to their hut), then mine the resulting concrete. The Concrete Mixer will only make concrete and concrete powder when they receive a request for a block and have the needed materials. (All their recipes are pretaught.)
