The University is where a Researcher will research various upgrades to your colony.

As you level up the University, you can hire more researchers:

| Max Researchers | University Level |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| 1               | 1                |
| 2               | 2                |
| 3               | 3                |
| 4               | 4                |
| 5               | 5                |

**Note:** Research time is real-world time spent in-game. However, Researchers will sometimes use offline time to work on researches. Researchers' Knowledge skill affects the amount of research time they get from the offline time (it's not a 1:1 ratio), and their Mana skill affects the max amount of research time they can get. Offline research time is unlocked at University level 3.
