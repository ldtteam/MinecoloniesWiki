The Plantation is where the Planter will grow either sugar cane, bamboo, or cactus.

The Plantation's level determines how many crops the Planter can plant at a time.

| Plantation Level | Crops Grown |
|------------------|-------------|
| 1                | 4           |
| 2                | 8           |
| 3                | 12          |
| 4                | 16          |
| 5                | 20          |

The Planter can also craft paper, books, sugar, and anything made with bamboo. The Planter will only make these items when they have been taught the recipes, receive a request for an item, and have the needed materials.

**Note:** The Planter can only learn a certain amount of recipes per their hut level. 

| Building Level | Number of Recipes |
|----------------|-------------------|
| 1              | 10                |
| 2              | 20                |
| 3              | 40                |
| 4              | 80                |
| 5              | 160               |
