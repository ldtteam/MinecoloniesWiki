The Blacksmith is a 3x3 crafter and can make any vanilla tools, armor, swords, and shields (no bows or redstone items). The Blacksmith will work when they receive a request for any of those items from another worker. 

**Note:** You will need to teach the Blacksmith the recipes of the items you want them to create. The number of items the Blacksmith can learn are listed below:

| Building Level | Number of Recipes |
|----------------|-------------------|
| 1              | 10                |
| 2              | 20                |
| 3              | 40                |
| 4              | 80                |
| 5              | 160               |

Additionally, upon reaching level 5, the Blacksmith learns the nine netherite recipes (shovel, hoe, pickaxe, axe, sword, helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots), which count toward the recipe total above.

When a colonist is requesting a tool from the Blacksmith with multiple accepted levels, the Blacksmith will craft whichever tool type is highest in their list of recipes that they have the materials for (when you teach them a new recipe, it'll go on the bottom).
