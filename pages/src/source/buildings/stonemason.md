### Note: The Stonemason's Hut cannot be built until you have a level 1 [Blacksmith's Hut](../../source/buildings/blacksmith) and have finished the research in the [University](../../source/buildings/university).
<br>

The Stonemason's Hut is where the Stonemason will craft 3x3 recipes made entirely out of cobblestone, stone, andesite, diorite, granite, quartz, purpur, nether bricks, prismarine, sandstones, blackstone, basalt, and/or ores (no ingots or redstone items). They can also craft end stone from cobblestone and an ender pearl, but only if you have completed the Know the End [research](../../source/systems/research) in the [University](../../source/buildings/university). The Stonemason will only work when they receive a request from another worker and have the needed materials. You will also need to teach the Stonemason's Hut the recipes you want the Stonemason to craft.

**Hint:** Upgrading the Stonemason's Hut lets you teach it more recipes. So:

| Building Level | Number of Recipes |
| :------------: | :---------------: |
|       1        |        10         |
|       2        |        20         |
|       3        |        40         |
|       4        |        80         |
|       5        |        160        |
