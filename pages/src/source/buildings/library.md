### Note: The Library cannot be built until you finish the research in the [University](../../source/buildings/university).

The Library is a way for you to raise your adult citizens' Intelligence skill, which influences all other skill increases (at other jobs). A citizen will randomly level up their Intelligence as long as they're assigned to the Library. Being a Library Student is their full-time job, so you can't have one citizen work at the Library and another worker hut at the same time.

Two citizens can study per Library level. So: 

| Building Level | Citizens Educated at a Time |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1              | 2                           |
| 2              | 4                           |
| 3              | 6                           |
| 4              | 8                           |
| 5              | 10                          |

**Hint:** Paper and books help Library Students increase their skills faster.
