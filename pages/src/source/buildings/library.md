### Note: The Library cannot be built until you finish the research in the [University](../../source/buildings/university).
<br>

The Library is a way for you to raise your adult citizens' Intelligence skill, which influences all other skill increases (at other jobs). A citizen will randomly level up their Intelligence as long as they're assigned to the Library. Being a Library Student is their full-time job, so you can't have one citizen work at the Library and another worker hut at the same time.

Two citizens can study per Library level. So: 

| Building Level | Citizens Educated at a Time |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1              | 2                           |
| 2              | 4                           |
| 3              | 6                           |
| 4              | 8                           |
| 5              | 10                          |

**Hint:** Paper and books help Library Students increase their skills faster.

## Library GUI

When accessing the Library's hut block by right-clicking on it, you will see a GUI with different options:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/librarygui.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="Library GUI">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <br>
    <ul>
      {% for item in site.data.gui.global %}
        <li><strong>{{ item.button }}:</strong> {{ item.content }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>  

This is page two of the Library GUI.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
        <img src="../../assets/images/gui/minstockgui.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="Library GUI 2">
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
        <ul>
        <li><strong> Minimum Stock: </strong> Use this button to tell the Library to keep a minimum stock on hand. Set items will be displayed above the button.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
