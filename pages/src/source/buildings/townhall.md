# Town Hall

{% capture content %}
The Town Hall is the central part of your colony.

**Note:** The Town Hall block **cannot** be crafted until **after** you have already placed the Town Hall you get from the [Supply Ship/Camp](../../source/items/supplycampandship). If needed, it can also be obtained in creative mode like any other block or by commands.

## Starting a New Colony

### Scouting the Area

Make sure you scout your area carefully before you decide where you want to place your Town Hall. Your colony will start with a 4 chunk radius (4 chunks in each direction) from the Town Hall block. Make sure this is where you want your colony to be.

### Placing your Town Hall

After you have carefully decided where you want to place your Town Hall (remember, the position where you placed the Town Hall block will be the center of your colony's protected area. Once placed, the area will be set and cannot be changed), use your [build tool](../items/buildtool) to place the Town Hall block.

Right-click the ground in the area you want to place the Town Hall. The building GUI will display showing the 3D preview of the building. You will be able to use the arrow buttons to move the building to the location you desire. 

**Note:** Make sure you use the + and - options in the GUI to make sure you have the ground level of the hut where you want the ground level to be. Not all hut blocks sit on the ground.

Once you commit to the placement of the Town Hall (green checkmark), the Town Hall block will be placed.

### Creating your Colony

Once you have placed the Town Hall block you will need to right-click on it and select Create New Colony. <br>
<img src="../../assets/images/gui/th_colonycreationGUI.png" alt="Creating New Colony" />

A new colony will be created, the area of your colony will be established, and the entire area will be protected.

### Protection Area

When you start a colony, the area that is initially set also has protections added to it. The protection system includes blocking any player from placing/breaking or interacting with blocks of any kind, placing lava or water, and placing/lighting TNT. Once established it will also show in the informational screen.

The protected area of your colony (once the Town Hall has been placed) will depend on the [configuration](../../source/misc/configfile), but will be 4 chunks radius by default, measured from where you placed your Town Hall block the first time. Therefore, plan carefully where you want to place your Town Hall. Your protected colony area includes mountains, hills, lakes, oceans, caves, world generated structures, etc. from bedrock to the sky limit.

Due to the protected area of each colony, you have to carefully scout your surroundings to make sure you are clear of any other colonies nearby preventing you from placing your Town Hall or limiting your colony area in that direction.

**Note:** Once you place your Town Hall block, this will be the CENTER of your Town's protected radius. If you decide that you want your actual Town Hall building to be built in a different location (within your currently set protected radius), you can break the block and place it again with your build tool. Removing and replacing the Town Hall block will NOT remove the Protected area of your Town. The only way to remove the protected area of your colony so that you can place a Town Hall somewhere else is by a person with OP or admin permission deleting your colony through [commands](../../source/systems/command).

If there is another colony too close to your current position, you won't be able to place a Town Hall.

If you try to place another Town Hall outside of your protected area, you will get a message: <br>

## Town Hall GUI

<i>You can use the tabs on the left side to switch between different categories.</i>

### <strong>Information:</strong> This is the overall information section of the Town Hall GUI.
   
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">

  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Page 1: </strong>Here you will see some statistics on your citizens, like the number of citizens you have out of your max. Green is less than 90% of your max, orange is above 90%, and red is full. If it's red, hovering over the numbers will show what you need to do to get more citizens. The page also shows how many of each type of worker you have.</li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Page 2: </strong>Here you will see the overall happiness of the colony's citizens and any events that happened within the colony (the newest events are at the bottom). You can click the button to switch to a permission log, which will show any illegal actions that happened in the colony (like if a player tried to break a block when they aren't allowed to). Clicking the plus next to an illegal action will change it to a legal action if the player tries to do it again. For more information, see the <a href="../../source/systems/protection"> Protection system</a> and the Permission tab of the Town Hall GUI.</li>

          <li><strong>Housing assignment mode: </strong>Clicking on this button lets you switch between automatic or manual.

In manual mode, you can select which citizens will be housed in each <a href="../../source/buildings/house"> House</a> or <a href="../../source/buildings/tavern"> Tavern</a>.

			<br>
            <li><strong>Edit Colony Flag: </strong>Clicking this button will open up a banner designer where you can design your colony banner. Your <a href="../../source/workers/guard"> Knights</a> will wear the finished design on their shields, and it is also used in some schematics.</li>
