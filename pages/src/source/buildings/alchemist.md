The {% building %} is where the {% worker_link alchemist %} works. The {% worker alchemist %} brews potions and harvests netherwart and mistletoe.

**Hint:** The number of recipes you can teach the {% building %} doubles per building level. So:

| {% include buildings/name.html %} Level | Number of Recipes |
|:---------------------------------------:|:-----------------:|
|                    1                    |        10         |
|                    2                    |        20         |
