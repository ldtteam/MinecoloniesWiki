The Mine is where you can hire a [Miner](../../source/workers/miner) to work the mine, or a [Quarrier](../../source/workers/quarrier) to work the [Quarry](../../source/buildings/quarry). If you hire a Quarrier, there will be no Miner at this Mine. 

At the Mine, the Miner will mine for ores and materials. Once they are hired, the Miner will first create a shaft downward to a specific depth depending on the level of the Mine.  Once the main shaft is completed, the Miner will then branch out.

While mining, sometimes the Miner will get lucky and get an ore block instead of a basic stone block. The chance of getting "Lucky Ores" is set in the [config](../../source/misc/configfile).

**Note:** Placing the Mine hut below the maximum Y level it can mine will cause the Miner not work and complain the hut needs to be upgraded.  To avoid this error, place the hut at least 4 blocks above the maximum depth for the hut level (above Y=54 for 1.16 or Y=44 for 1.18 level 1).  If you want your mine to be lower, you will need to upgrade it before the miner will work.

  <li><strong>Item</strong> Each needed item is displayed, along with how many of that item is in inventory, and how many are needed.  These amounts will change as they place blocks and will show only what blocks the Miner still needs to place. The block in black are in their inventory.  The blocks in red are the ones neither you nor the Miner has in their inventory.  The blocks in green are ones you have in inventory but the Miner needs.  Clicking the up arrow next to the item will automatically remove that item from your inventory and place it into the Mine hut's.</li>

Here you can assign what level of the Mine the Miner will create their mineshafts (nodes). If a level has a red number next to it, that means the Miner is currently mining that level. The Miner will ignore orders to mine at a specific level until the entire mineshaft is completed to the maximum depth their hut's level allows. You can also click Repair, to tell the Miner to restore that level to its original state. This can be useful if a fire breaks out in the mineshaft." image="../../assets/images/gui/minegui5.png" %}
