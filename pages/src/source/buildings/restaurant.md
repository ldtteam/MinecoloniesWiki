The Restaurant is where the Cook will cook food, provided they have the necessary ingredients and fuel. When citizens are hungry, they will come to the Restaurant and the Cook will give them food. The Assistant Cook also works at the Restaurant. They craft needed food to help supply the colony.

**Note:** You can only hire an Assistant Cook when the Restaurant is level 3 or higher.

Listed here are food items that will be handed out by the {% worker_link cook %}. Disable any you don't want to be handed out or produced.
However, if a colonist finds a disabled item, they'll still eat it - the {% worker_link cook %} just won't hand it out.
