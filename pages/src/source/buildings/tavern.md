# Tavern

{% capture content %}
The Tavern is like a [House](../../source/buildings/house) in that it houses citizens, however, the Tavern houses four instead of one and can't be upgraded to house more.

Every so often, visitors will come to the Tavern. You can recruit these visitors (with items) to live and work in your colony. Don't attack them, they'll fight back!
Upgrading the Tavern will garner more and better visitors.

Recruiting used to be part of the [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) but has been moved here.

**Note:** The Tavern can only be upgraded to level 3, not level 5. You can also only have 1 Tavern per colony.

If the second line is green, the Tavern is closer to their work hut. If it's yellow, it's farther. <br><br><strong>Building Assignment Mode</strong> allows you to override the Townhall's housing setting, for the Tavern only." image="../../assets/images/gui/housegui2.png" %}
