# Archer ([Guard](guard))

{% capture content %}
Archers are ranged guards that protect your colony. As long as you provide an Archer with a bow, they will protect your colony day and night. 

Archers will use armor when provided with some.

Archers don't require arrows to shoot, but can optionally use them for extra damage if you’ve completed the Consume Arrows [research](../../source/systems/research) in the [University](../../source/buildings/university).

The higher an Archer's Agility level, the more damage they'll do. The higher their Adaptability level, the greater their range will be.

## Archer in Training
Archers in Training will train at the [Archery](../buildings/archery) to become an Archer. They will use a bow to shoot practice dummies and will level up without a risk of dying to mobs.

Archers in Training are not actual Guards even though they are dressed in the usual Guard clothes. They will not help defend your colony, only Guards will do that.
