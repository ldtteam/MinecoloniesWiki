The Fisher is an important worker for your colony. As long as you provide the Fisher with a fishing rod, the Fisher will provide your colony with everything that can be caught: cod, salmon, pufferfish, tropical fish, junk, and sometimes even treasure like prismarine and sponges!

The higher a Fisher's Focus and Agility levels, the less time it'll take before they catch something.

**Note:** The Fisher will require a body of water a minimum of 7 x 7 x 1 blocks for them to be able to work, and it must be near their hut.
