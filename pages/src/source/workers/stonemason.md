The Stonemason is part of your colonyâ€™s crafting line. The Stonemason can craft items and blocks made entirely out of cobblestone, stone, andesite, diorite, granite, quartz, nether bricks, purpur, prismarine, sandstones, blackstone, basalt, and/or ores (no ingots or redstone items). They can also craft end stone from cobblestone and an ender pearl, but only if you have completed the Know the End [research](../../source/systems/research) in the {% building_link university %}. The Stonemason will only make items when they have been taught the recipes, receive a request for an item, and have the needed materials.

**Note:** The Stonemason can only learn a set number of recipes based on their hut level. So:

| Hut Level | Recipes |
|-----------|---------|
| 1         | 10      |
| 2         | 20      |
| 3         | 40      |
| 4         | 80      |
| 5         | 160     |

All crafters have a chance to decrease the amount of materials needed for a taught recipe. (If this happens, the new recipe is kept until deleted or improved again.) The higher a Stonemason's Creativity level, the greater their chance to decrease the amount of materials needed.

The Stonemason will craft faster with a higher Dexterity level.
