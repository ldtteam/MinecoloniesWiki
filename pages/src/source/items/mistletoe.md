Mistletoe is an item that [Foresters](../../source/workers/forester) and [Alchemists](../../source/workers/alchemist) can gather randomly.

## Using the Mistletoe

Mistletoe is used by Alchemists to craft magic potions for [Druids](../../source/workers/druid). These potions increase the strength and duration of Druid potions.
