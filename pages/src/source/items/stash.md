The Stash lets a player deposit items that they want to be picked up by a {% worker courier %} to take to the {% building warehouse %}.

The Stash can be crafted at the {% building sawmill %} or by the player.

## Using the Stash

To use the Stash, right-click on it to bring up its inventory, which works like a chest. 
Put items in the stash and a Courier from the nearest Warehouse will pick them up and deposit them in the Warehouse for workers or your own {% include links/systems.html key="request" %}.
