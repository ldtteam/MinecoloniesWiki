The clipboard is an easy way to see all the requests your workers have (that are not being fulfilled by a [Courier](../../source/workers/courier)).

## Using the Clipboard

When you first make the clipboard and right-click anywhere, you will get a message to sneak + right-click on the [Town Hall](../../source/buildings/townhall) to register the clipboard.

<br>

After you register the clipboard, this message will appear:
<br>

<br>

Now when you right-click while holding the clipboard, you will see all your citizens' requests on the clipboard (that are not being fulfilled by a [Courier](../../source/workers/courier)) as long as you're close to your colony!

If you click on the exclamation mark in the top right, you will only see requests for things that workers need *right now.*
