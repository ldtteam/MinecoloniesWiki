# MineColonies Wiki

A wiki for the Minecraft mod [MineColonies](https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies). Read it [here](https://wiki.minecolonies.ldtteam.com/)!

## Guidelines to pages

### Worker/building names
We want to avoid having to change a bazillion occurences all over the wiki in case we ever need to rename a worker or a building, for that reason there are 2 tags (`{% building /%}` and `{% worker /%}`) which you can use to write the name of the building/worker directly based on the name defined in the data files.

You can use these by doing `{% building /%}` (only directly in the building source page) OR `{% building name="<key>" %}` (when referring to a building outside of the building page itself). This setup is identical for the worker (by using `{% worker name="<key>" /%}`).

### Links
We have a lot of links in the website referring to other documentation pages, a lot of them are still configured with a manually written name + path, for example: `[Apiary](/source/buildings/apiary)`.

Going forwards we are using link templates, these are created using Markdoc tags.

#### Buildings
In order to write a building link you have to write: `{% building name="<key>" /%}` where the key of the building can be found in the `src/content/buildings`.

These link templates will automatically generate the path to the building aswell as use the proper name defined the in `src/content/buildings`.

#### Workers
In order to write a worker link you have to write: `{% worker name="<key>" /%}` where the key of the worker can be found in the `src/content/workers`.

These link templates will automatically generate the path to the worker aswell as use the proper name defined the in `src/content/workers`.

## Testing locally
The project can be ran locally to test if your changes work as expected. You need the following installed to be able to run it.

- Nodejs (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Pnpm (https://pnpm.io/installation)

After cloning the project and having all the required tools installed you need to run:

- pnpm install

This will install all of the project dependencies defined in the `package.json`.

### Running the project
The project is served using the Astro CLI, this will start up a development server where you can test your changes.

In order to serve the project locally you have to run:

- pnpm start
